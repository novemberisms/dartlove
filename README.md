# Dartlove

Love2D ported to Dart for developing web games using HTML canvas. Devs familiar with the LOVE2D API will feel right at home and get to create games with Dart!

# Notice!

This library is under heavy construction! I will update this page with documentation and examples in the near future. This is my first package for pub (Dart's package manager) so I'm still learning!
